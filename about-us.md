      Mestara was established as an Indonesia women-led organisation, with a
      drive to empower Indonesian female students and graduates in career
      advancement, while breaking down the social and cultural factors
      perpetuating early marriage and poverty. 


      We work towards a vision in which Indonesian women have fair and equal
      opportunities to pursue their dreams so that they could transform their
      lives and exit poverty for good.
