          I have improved many things during my 6 weeks as a Mestara mentee,
          from financial planning to professional communication, plus I was able
          to 1:1 coaching with cool mentors. Another bonus, you can have a lot
          of cool friends. Thank you Mestara for the most productive 6 weeks.
